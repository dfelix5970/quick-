<h1>Effects of Alcohol on the body</h1>
<p>Excessive alcohol use can cause the pancreas to produce toxic substances that interfere with proper functioning. The resulting inflammation is called pancreatitis, a serious problem that can destroy the pancreas. One of the most frequent causes of chronic pancreatitis is alcohol abuse.</p> 
<h2>Effect of Alcohol in social life</h2>
<p>Sometimes moods get so bad that you are violent and start abusing your wife and sometimes even your children. At other times, usually after a few strong drinks you feel elated and ready to love anyone. These mood swings are confusing and upsetting to your family. They are especially hard on your children who see you abusing your wife. This can often lead to domestic violence.</p>
<h1>How to quit?</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Do you want to stop drinking altogether or just cut back? If your goal is to reduce your drinking, decide which days you will drink alcohol and how many drinks you will allow yourself per day. Try to commit to at least two days each week when you don't drink at all.</li>
    <li>When do you want to stop drinking or start drinking less? Tomorrow? In a week? Next month? Within six months? If you're trying to stop drinking, set a specific quit date.</li>
    <li>After you've set your goals to either stop or cut back your drinking, write down some ideas on how you can help yourself accomplish these goals. For example:</li>
    <li>Get rid of temptations. Remove all alcohol, barware, and other drinking reminders from your home and office.</li>
    <li>Announce your goal. Let friends, family members, and co-workers know that you're trying to stop drinking. If they drink, ask them to support your recovery by not doing so in front of you.</li>
    <li>Be upfront about your new limits. Make it clear that drinking will not be allowed in your home and that you may not be able to attend events where alcohol is being served.</li>
    <li>Avoid bad influences. Distance yourself from people who don't support your efforts to stop drinking or respect the limits you've set. This may mean giving up certain friends and social connections.</li>
    <li>Learn from the past. Reflect on previous attempts to stop drinking. What worked? What didn't? What can you do differently this time to avoid pitfalls?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Personal experience</h1>
<h2>Carol's Story</h2>
<p>Never really gave it a thought, it's just a wine or two or three. I am not depressed; I have my health and a good job. Just lost myself and I need me back. A few days ago I ran into a friend whom I have not seen in a few years. She told me she was sober for one year and it really made me stop and take stock of my life. This is not going to be easy but I can do this. I have grandkids that I want to hang with and a supportive husband that I want to keep sharing experiences with. I am only two days into this and glad I came across this book and site.</p>
